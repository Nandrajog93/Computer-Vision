# What is it?

1. Facial Recognition using Machine Learning : Build an App that basically train recognizing your face using MachineLearning.

Language & Knowledge Inferred: OpenCv, HAAR cascade classifier, LBPHFaceRecognizer.

2. Gender Detection using Keras pre-trained model and opencv: Detecting Gender using Keras Pretrained model,eye detection using HAAR cascade classifier

Language & Knowledge Inferred: OpenCv, HAAR cascade classifier, Keras pre-trained model

3. Computer vision basics : Reading,Writing, Edge Detection etc.

# Installation
Installation is very easy as these are .IPYNB file so just download these scripts to you desired directory but in the case for gender detection first download the pre-trained model.
